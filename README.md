# Fuel economy analysis

Analysis of the fuel economy data from the US EPA dataset: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml
The particular file being analyzed is https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/epadata/vehicles.csv.zip “Datasets for All
Model Years (1984–2019)”. The data dictionary is here: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml#vehicle

Some questions that are in particular focus in this analysis: 

1. Which manufacturer produces the most fuel efficient fleet of cars?
2. Build a model to predict city mpg (variable “UCity” in column BG).
3. How has fuel economy changed over time? Are there any other interesting insights or trends?
